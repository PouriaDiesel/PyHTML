By using PyHTML,you can create responsive HTML outputs
for Python with program self created windows that are
generated by wxPython.It works like Selenium and could
render any CSS/JS library like "Bootstrap","JQuery",...

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
to install <strong>PyHTML</strong>requirments from 
freezed [reqiurement](requirements.txt) file:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Now you only need to import [functions.py](functions.py)
to your project.

## Example
Add your HTML code to templates folder for example
[index.html](templates/index.html).As you see,we have 
some parameters like {{title}},{{text}} that passed 
from python to HTML.<br>You can pass any DJango 
[Tags/Parameters/Blocks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/builtins/) 
to your design.After adding templates,you could render 
your HTML from any Python/Django program in a wxPython 
windows by using:

```python
from functions import *

if __name__ == '__main__':
    django_init()
    render_a_html('index.html', 'RenderedIndex.html', {"title": "HelloWorld!", "text": "Hello World!"})
```
before using `render_a_html`,you need to call 
django_init() from [functions.py](functions.py).You can 
customize your own project settings by edditing this function.
<br>This function is needed to call before using wxPython.
First argument of `render_a_html` is your raw HTML template and
second is rendered output name and third is context of variables 
that will pass from Python to HTML.
